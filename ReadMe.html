<FONT SIZE=3>The reason of the projects is an alternative way of 
asynchronous of  chain of forked tasks. The Fork/Join framework is a
well known tool and does not needs any introducing remarks.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal">
<FONT SIZE=3>The Fork/Join framework uses the join concept, it can
fork a task execution and joints the forked task by mean of joint on
a fiber ( a used thread in a domestic JVM). This model does not use
separated OS threads per tasks (user thread instead of it), OS thread
really does not wait for a task execution (just resumes fiber's
stack) , but still allocates stacks for fibers and uses wait model.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.17in; margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal">
<FONT SIZE=3>The recent exercise project demonstrates an alternative
idea: a  fork &ndash; continue  concept, when no one task is pending
for a fork execution, but continues worklfow by handling callbacks
(or events)  from its  forked tasks (either result, or failure) in
absolutely asynchronous mode , as well as execution of initial and
forked tasks. The stack of  any call is just one method with no 
recursions. Any thread just executed a Runnable, which  envelops
either a task with parameters, or  a callback, which calls the parent
task.</FONT></P>

	task  is derived from a class TaskNode , which have the interface
	abstract method execute and the protected abstract
	onFailure(Throwable,Serializable), onResult(RESULT,Serializable).
	The TaskNode class has also the method fork(TaskNode, Serializable,)
	 which gets a new tasks instance to be executed  and any reminder
	object .   The reminder will be returned back by system, when
	triggering the onResult/onFailure in order to simplify
	identification of an event.    Work of a NodeTask is completed by
	means of calling either of the methods : doResult(RESULT)-when
	completed successfully, , or failure(Throwable)-when error occurred.
	If  a not trapped exception occurred, then task will be terminated,
	its children removed and a parent will get notification (onFailure)
	about the case, or if it is an initial task, then related callback
	will be called directly.</FONT></P>

	NodeTask contains and uses also an interface IExecutionContext,
	which is just an entry point to executive poll.  Inside a call of
	the fork(..) method, a BiConsumers (callbacks) a created to handle
	failure or completion of entire forked task. The callbacks just call
	onFailure and onResult methods, which are overriden by a real task
	class.</FONT></P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal">   <FONT SIZE=3>A
	NodeTask derived object has a life cycle, which  is initiated by
	call of the execute(..) method, inside of which  either work must be
	completed by means of calling doResult( or failure()), or a fork
	should be called with a newly created task. The life cycle
	continued, in the case, when  the fork(...) called, inside the
	onResult(..) or onFailure methods call as reaction on callback call
	by container of executive pool. If  fork has not been called, then 
	a task becomes to be a subject of GC after  the execute(...) method
	called. If fork called, then task guaranty will be kept till last of
	callbacks called. </FONT>
